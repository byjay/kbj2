> [!IMPORTANT]
> **KBJ2** is the *Organization*, not the *Product*.
> **SEDMS** is just one of many projects managed by KBJ2.

## 1. System Identity (정체성)
- **Role**: Universal Orchestrator (범용 지휘 통제기).
- **Capability**: Can manage Shipbuilding, SaaS, Fintech, Novel Writing, construction, etc.
- **Workforce**: 122 Specialized Agents (30-Year Veterans).
    - They are "Mercenaries" (용병) who adapt their expertise to the *Active Project*.

## 2. Architecture (구조)
- **Core Engine**: `F:\kbj2` (The Headquarters).
- **Project Sites**: 
    - `F:\aicitybuilders` (Project: SEDMS Enterprise)
    - `F:\other_project` (Project: X)
    - `F:\future_project` (Project: Y)

## 3. Usage (사용법)
The Commander (User) calls `kbj2` with a specific order. KBJ2 detects the context and deploys the swarm.

```powershell
# Command Syntax
kbj2 "YOUR_COMMAND_HERE"
```

### Examples
1. **SEDMS Project** (Current Active):
   ```powershell
   kbj2 "로고 수정해" 
   # Result: KBJ2 deploys Design Team to F:\aicitybuilders
   ```

2. **New Project** (Future):
   ```powershell
   kbj2 "신규 프로젝트 'Alpha' 초기화해"
   # Result: KBJ2 creates F:\alpha and sets up scaffolding.
   ```

Every agent in `personas.py` has been upgraded with:
- **Experience**: 30+ Years.
- **Thinking Model**: First Principles, Zero-Defect, Machiavellian Strategy.
- **Behavior**: They don't just "do" tasks; they *audit*, *critique*, and *optimize* them.
